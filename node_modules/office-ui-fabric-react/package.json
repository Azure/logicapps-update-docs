To view the documentation including examples, contracts, component status, and to add functionality or fix issues locally, you can:\r\n\r\n1. `git clone https://github.com/OfficeDev/office-ui-fabric-react.git`\r\n2. `npm install`\r\n3. `npm start`\r\n\r\nThis will run `gulp serve` from the office-ui-fabric-react package folder, which will open a web browser with the example page. You can make changes to the code which will automatically build and refresh the page using live-reload.\r\n\r\nTo build all packages in the repo, you can use `npm run build`.\r\n\r\nTo run other Gulp commands such as clean or deploy, just prepend the command with `npm run gulp` and this will run the command from within the project context.\r\n\r\n`npm run gulp clean`\r\n`npm run gulp deploy`\r\n...\r\n\r\n## Get started\r\n\r\n### Tutorial\r\n[Here is a step by step tutorial](https://github.com/OfficeDev/office-ui-fabric-react/blob/master/ghdocs/README.md) on how to build a simple React app with an Office UI Fabric React component.\r\n\r\n### Integrate into an existing project\r\nIntegrating components into your project depends heavily on your setup. The recommended setup is to use a bundler such as Webpack which can resolve NPM package imports in your code and can bundle the specific things you import.\r\n\r\nWithin an npm project, you should install the package and save it as a dependency:\r\n\r\n```\r\nnpm install --save office-ui-fabric-react\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will add the fabric-react project as a dependency in your package.json file, and will drop the project under node_modules/office-ui-fabric-react.\r\n\r\nThe library includes commonjs entry points under the lib folder. To use a control, you should be able to import it and use it in your render method:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport * as React from 'react';\r\nimport * as ReactDOM from 'react-dom';\r\nimport { Button } from 'office-ui-fabric-react/lib/Button';\r\n\r\nconst MyPage = () => (<div><Button>I am a button.</Button></div>);\r\n\r\nReactDOM.render(<MyPage />, document.body.firstChild);\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Advanced usage\r\n\r\nFor advanced usage including info about module vs. path-based imports, using an AMD bundler like Require, and deployment features, see our [advanced documentation](https://github.com/OfficeDev/office-ui-fabric-react/blob/master/ghdocs/ADVANCED.md).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Roadmap\r\n\r\nThe Fabric React project is currently in a **pre-v1 state** which means that we're working hard on achieving our v1 - a set of powerful and easy to use components built to the Office Design Language that are used *in production*. We will be actively working on this set as teams across Office and Office 365 contribute, evolve, and use these components in their own products.\r\n\r\nGiven the early state of the project, all things are subject to change and some components may be more stable/usable than others. Use at your own risk!\r\n\r\nOur goal is to build out the components to be:\r\n- Well documented\r\n- Have clear contracts\r\n- Keyboard accessible\r\n- Screen reader friendly\r\n- RTL friendly\r\n- Support high contrast mode\r\n- Generally bug-free\r\n\r\nWe hope to develop more concrete goals for the project's components in the future with a primary focus on explaining which components are used in production. Stay tuned to learn more.\r\n\r\n## Trello board\r\n\r\nFabric React contains a variety of components that are a part of the Office / Office 365 design language. If you're not seeing a component here that you'd like, first check out the [Fabric React Requests Trello board](https://trello.com/b/hBP8XdvR/office-ui-fabric-react-requests) and upvote it there (if it exists), or file an [issue on Fabric React's issue tracker](https://github.com/OfficeDev/office-ui-fabric-react/issues) to kick off a new request.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Browser support\r\n\r\nFabric React supports many commonly used browsers. See the [browser support doc](https://github.com/OfficeDev/office-ui-fabric-react/blob/master/ghdocs/BROWSERSUPPORT.md) for more information.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Contribute to Fabric React\r\n\r\nWe're excited to share our development of this project with folks outside of the company, but please keep in mind that we're moving towards a v1 state which requires that we stay focused on reaching that goal. With this in mind, take a look at our [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/OfficeDev/office-ui-fabric-react/blob/master/ghdocs/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more info on how we plan to look at issues, how to structure your commit messages, and more.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Licenses\r\n\r\nAll files on the Office UI Fabric React GitHub repository are subject to the MIT license.
