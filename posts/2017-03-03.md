## Release Notes:
* Logic App can now show previous versions of the logic app and promote previous versions to production

## Bug Fixes:
* Service Bus message content on "Send Message" would sometimes reload as 'raw' @base64 representation
* Query parameters with a "." would not reload correctly
* Support for single quote characters in action names (localization)
* Some combinations of compose, flat file encode, or nested workflows could result in larger file sizes than we support (50 MB)
