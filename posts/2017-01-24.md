Apologies for the delay.  There was a tooling issue so the last 2 updates didn't post.  Also starting with next week we will start posting these in advance of a release so you can be aware of changes that may effect you before they roll out.  Feel free to contact us for questions - [logicappsemail@microsoft.com](mailto:logicappsemail@microsoft.com).  Also would be a great Logic App to trigger on RSS updates from this blog and send you a notification email ðŸ™‚
