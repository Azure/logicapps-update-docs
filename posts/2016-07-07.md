## Release Notes:
* Logic App designer will not modify any values that weren't modified after load.  You can make any changes in code-view and on load will always save in same state as long as the field wasn't modified in the designer.
* Expose "headers" in outputs of the request trigger
* @result(<scopeName>) for exception handling

## Bug Fixes:
* Fixed styling of the Azure Functions card
* Logic Apps with request triggers weren't properly listed in nested workflow action
* Delay action would revert to minutes
* Dynamic swagger wasn't properly using specified method to make calls
* Using workflow expression in condition/filter/array would result in disabled text box on reload
* ForEach would be added to the Filter action array
* XML Validation should fail gracefully when no schema is provided
