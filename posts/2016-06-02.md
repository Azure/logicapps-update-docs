## Release Notes:
* Added a "poll now" callback URL as a header to recurrent polling triggers "x-ms-trigger-callback-url"
* If you write a polling trigger (as documented here), the request from the engine to the trigger will contain a header with a URL.  A POST to that URL will cause the engine immediately poll the trigger again for information - regardless of how much time is left on the 'retry-after' timer.
* Added support for sequential foreach loops - will be available with new schema 2016-04-01-preview
* Work in preparation for 2016-04-01-preview release coming soon

## Bug Fixes:
* Fixed some issues with drag and drop in designer.
