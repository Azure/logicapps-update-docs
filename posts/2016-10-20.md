Tons of new features that have been rolled out (and rolling out starting today).  I accidentally set last weeks to publish on 10/13/2017 - so just combining both updates into this week.  Be sure to check out our webcast where we demo'd much of this and shared what's coming next â€“ [http://aka.ms/logicappslive](http://aka.ms/logicappslive)

## Release Notes:
* Resubmit button added to the run view to resubmit a run
* Ability to regenerate callback URLs for request triggers
* Added chart and metrics for billable actions by logic app (below list of runs)
* Performance improvements for designer load time and run view load time
* New output picker experience (Add Dynamic Values) with search for outputs
* ForEach allows multiple actions
* Cognitive Services Text Analytics connector
* Will always show delete and rename but give info when actions cannot be performed
* @base64 can now encode JSON objects

## Bug Fixes:
* Drag and drop bugs
